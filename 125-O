Sure, here are the average time complexities for the operations on an AVL tree:

- Inserting the value n: O(log n)
- Removing the node with the value n: O(log n)
- Searching for a node in an AVL tree of size n: O(log n)

AVL trees maintain balance, which ensures that the height of the tree remains O(log n), leading to these time complexities for these operations.
